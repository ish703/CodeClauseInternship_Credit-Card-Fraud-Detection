# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project was developed as part of the **CodeClause Internship**.  
It aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques on an imbalanced dataset.

---

## 🎯 Aim

To detect fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset using classification models and data balancing techniques.

---
## 🧠 Problem Statement
- Fraudulent transactions are rare and hard to detect.
- The dataset contains 284,807 transactions with only 492 fraud cases.
- The challenge is to identify frauds without getting misled by the class imbalance.


## 📄 Description

The dataset contains anonymized credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.  
The key challenge is that fraudulent transactions are very rare compared to genuine ones.

To tackle this, the project includes:
- Handling imbalanced data using under-sampling
- Applying Logistic Regression for binary classification
- Evaluating the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
